/**
 * Result-row normalization — turning each driver's native value into ONE canonical form, so the same
 * logical row reads identically on every dialect AND in every language port.
 *
 * The 2026-07-19 audit found the engine performed no normalization at all, so one logical value came
 * back four different ways. Corpus C (`contract/corpora/normalization/corpus.json`) is the contract
 * this satisfies; the Dart port implements the same forms in `dart/engine/lib/src/normalize.dart`.
 *
 * It is deliberately CONSERVATIVE: it converts only what the DIALECT EXECUTOR has positively
 * identified from the driver's own column metadata. It never guesses from a value's shape — a `note`
 * column holding "2024-04-01" is text a user wrote, not a timestamp, and rewriting it would corrupt
 * data to make a table look tidy.
 *
 * ── WHY NORMALIZATION IS COLUMN-DRIVEN, NOT VALUE-DRIVEN (fixed 2026-07-21) ──
 * The first version rewrote every `Date` it saw into one zone-less form. That was wrong, and
 * measurably so: three different column types arrive as an indistinguishable `Date`, and flattening
 * them lost real information. Measured against the harness on an `America/New_York` machine:
 *
 *     TIMESTAMPTZ '2024-04-01 10:00:00+00'  ->  "2024-04-01T06:00:00"   <- WRONG: shifted into the
 *     TIMESTAMPTZ '2024-04-01 10:00:00-04'  ->  "2024-04-01T10:00:00"      reader's local zone, the
 *     DATE        '2024-04-01'              ->  "2024-04-01T00:00:00"      offset silently discarded
 *
 * Two distinct instants became two different naive strings, and which strings you got depended on
 * the reading machine's `TZ`. That is the same silent-corruption class as the MySQL `TINYINT(1)`
 * bug — the read succeeds and the digits are simply different.
 *
 * So a temporal value now carries its column's KIND, and each kind gets the canonical form that
 * actually represents it. A `Date` whose kind the executor could not determine is LEFT ALONE:
 * refusing to guess is the whole point, and handing back the driver's own object is the honest
 * answer to "I do not know what this is".
 *
 * ── THE KNOWN BOUNDARY: CONTAINERS ──
 * This normalizes SCALAR columns. A Postgres `timestamp[]` arrives as a real `Array` of `Date`s,
 * which is not itself a `Date`, so the container passes through and the `Date`s inside stay exactly
 * as the driver built them — measured, and the same on the Dart port:
 *
 *     SELECT ARRAY[TIMESTAMP '2024-04-01 10:00:00']   ->   [Date]  <- not canonicalized
 *
 * That is deliberate, not an oversight. Reaching inside a container would invent a canonical form
 * for arrays and ranges that corpus C has never defined, on two ports at once, and the contract is
 * the thing that decides these — not this module. The same applies to the types no driver reduces to
 * a `Date` at all: Postgres `time`/`timetz`/`interval`, and T-SQL `time`. They have no canonical form
 * yet and are passed through untouched rather than guessed at.
