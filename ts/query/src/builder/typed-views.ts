/**
 * Per-engine typed views over the single {@link QueryBuilder} runtime class.
 *
 * SQLEasy is an honest capability surface: hitting the dot should show only what the engine you are
 * on can actually do. The runtime enforces that by throwing (the floor, and all Go can do); these
 * views add the compile-time ceiling for TypeScript — a method a dialect cannot run is not on that
 * dialect's builder type, so it does not autocomplete and does not compile.
 *
 * There is ONE runtime class. A dialect facade (`MssqlQuery.newBuilder()`, …) constructs a
 * `QueryBuilder` and returns it typed as the narrow view; the object is unchanged, only its static
 * type is narrowed. Structural typing makes this sound — `QueryBuilder` really does have every
 * method each view exposes — and the {@link _assertQueryBuilderSatisfiesViews} guard fails the build
 * if that ever stops being true.
 *
 * ── HOW THE VIEW IS DERIVED (mechanism, proven before it was written) ──
 * {@link BuilderView} maps over a curated set of method keys and, for every method that returns the
 * builder (`this`, which resolves to `QueryBuilder` when indexed), REBINDS the return to the viewing
 * type `Self` — so `mssql.selectAll().where(…).top(…)` stays typed as the MSSQL view through the
 * whole chain. Terminal methods that return something else (`parsePrepared`, `state`, …) keep their
 * real return. Everything NOT in the key set is simply absent.
 *
 * Two other approaches were measured and rejected: a `this`-returning `Omit<QueryBuilder, K>` does
 * NOT drop the omitted method (polymorphic `this` reintroduces it), and a method typed to `never` on
 * the wrong dialect still autocompletes and only fails on call — which defeats the "hit the dot"
 * test. Only structural absence via this mapped-type derivation passes.

// The rollout tightens these as the capability manifest is adjudicated. Only cells that are ACTUALLY

// dishonesty this surface exists to remove, pointed the other way.

// Each view is an `interface extends`, not a `type` alias, because a view passes ITSELF as `Self`
// (so builder-returning methods report the view type and chaining stays narrow) — and a `type` alias
// cannot reference itself (TS2456), while an interface can. The bodies are intentionally empty: the
// whole shape comes from `BuilderView`. The empty-object-type lint is disabled per view for exactly
// that reason.
